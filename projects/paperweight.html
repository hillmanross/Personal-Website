    <h2>CNC Mill and Lathe Paperweight</h2>

    <p>This was a small project I did for my manufacturing class. I personally made the design for the blue wax "crown" of the paperweight, but there were much more restrictions on the aluminum base so I kept it simple. The crown is attached to the base with four screws in the that go through the base and into the bottom of the crown. All the holes were mnaually threaded with a threading tool.</p>

    <p>Due to the font choice, the "NCSU" did not come out correctly.</p>

    <h2>Who is Ross Hillman?</h2>
    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>I am a senior studying for my bachelor's degree in industrial and systems engineering at North Carolina State University. I started this website as a way to host pictures of various projects that I've worked on so I could easily show them to friends, family, and professional connections. Since then, I've added a little bit more and am in the process of learning HTML and CSS so I can make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.</p>
    <p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
